			<p>Artist Craig McPherson is known for his New York murals, as well as paintings, mezzotint engravings, pastels and drawings on a variety of subjects, reflecting a 30-year tenure in New York City and a 50-year professional art career.</p>
<a title="167th and Jumel Place Rain (Detail)" href="paintings.html"><img class="float_lefttop" src="uploads/images/paintings/bigsnow_thumb.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100" /></a>McPherson's work has been exhibited in one-man gallery shows in New York, where he is represented by Forum Gallery, and in group shows all over the world. His body of work also includes a number of corporate and museum commissions. In 1998 he had his first museum retrospective at The Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, England. The show traveled to The Hunterian Museum in Glasgow, Scotland. In 2008 McPherson was commissioned by the Frick Museum to create an exhibition reflecting the heritage of steel production in Pittsburgh as part of that city's 250th anniversary celebration. His most recent show at Forum Gallery "Steel/Stage" focused on images from heavy industry, experimental theater and theater interiors.
<p><a title="Yankee Stadium at Night (Detail)" href="mezzotints/Yankee-Stadium-at-Night-detail.html"><img class="float_righttop" title="Yankee Stadium (Detail)" src="uploads/images/mezzotints/yankstaddet_thumb.jpg" alt="Yankee Stadium (Detail)" width="100" height="100" /></a>During the late 70's and early 80's McPherson concentrated on New York City landscapes, primarily at night, creating a series of paintings and prints in the rare graphic medium of mezzotint. This includes the iconic image, "Yankee Stadium at Night." His work has been described as "cinematic," the night scenes likened to film noir. One curator, describing work from this period, wrote "McPherson is almost literally 'sculpting with light'." In 1983, McPherson had his first one-man exhibition at the A.M. Sachs Gallery on 57th Street in New York, where The New York Times critic Grace Glueck likened his paintings to those of the 17th Century Dutch master, Koninck.</p>
<p><a title="New York, February, Night (Detail)" href="murals1.html"><img class="float_lefttop" title="New York, February, Night (Detail)" src="uploads/images/murals/NY_thumb.jpg" alt="New York, February, Night (Detail)" width="100" height="100" /></a>From 1985 to 1992 McPherson spent seven years on commissioned paintings, including one of the largest mural cycles ever undertaken in New York City. The murals were commissioned by the American Express Company for their corporate headquarters at the World Financial Center, Brookfield Place, in lower Manhattan. These included a 90-foot mural cycle for the auditorium (1985-86), followed by a 318-foot cycle for the main lobby (1987-92). The first mural cycle is composed of four paintings titled, "Twilight: The Waterways and Bridges of Manhattan." The second project, titled "Harbors of the World," is comprised of ten paintings 11-feet high and 318 feet in length, six of the paintings are 42-50 feet long. The project involved working on site in New York, Venice, Istanbul, Hong Kong, Sydney and Rio de Janeiro for the first 14 months, followed by four years of studio work in New York. The Harbors murals are on permanent view in the American Express Company lobby at 200 Vesey Street. These paintings comprise one of the largest mural cycles in the U.S.</p>

He has combined metaphoric elements and performers from experimental theatre. The New York Times critic Ken Johnson called his 2001 show featuring a 60-foot pastel of water, "a spectacular tour de force." He wrote, "It verges on abstraction, yet produces an enveloping cinematically lush effect."</p>
