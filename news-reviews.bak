<p>Craig McPherson has moved to a new studio where he's completed a series of mezzotint engravings: 
<a href="mezzotints/et2.html" target="_new">
<span class="strong">ET2</span></a>, 23 1/2 x 39 3/4”; 
<a href="mezzotints/hemplines.html" target="_new"><span class="strong">Hemp Lines I</span></a>, 11 1/4 X 23
1/4”; and <a href="mezzotints/memento-mori.html" target="_new"><span class="strong">Memento Mori</span></a>, 
13 1/2 X 16 1/2”. 
ET2 is his second version of the Edgar Thomson steel mill. It is the largest mezzotint he has attempted, 
requiring over two years to complete. Memento Mori, a stripped car in the snow, was created during the 
economic crisis of 2008-9 and is a commentary on the near demise of the American automobile industry. 
Hemp Lines I is the first of three variations on this theater subject to be completed. <span class="strong">The Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, England</span>, has acquired all of the new mezzotints for their collection.</p>

<p>Museums that have added his work to their collections recently
include: <span class="strong">The Nelson Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas
City, MS; The Montclair Museum of Art, Montclair, NJ; The Mary and Leigh
Block Museum of Art, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL. The National
